This site was created by **Edward Putera Rusli / XA5 / 11**.

## Dependencies
- create-react-app
- tailwindcss
- postcss
- autoprefixer

## Features
- Created with ReactJS
- Add & remove tasks
- Edit existing tasks
- Mark tasks as done
- `nth-child` coloring of tasks
- Transition when marking tasks
- Functionality & design closely resembles the example website, differences being:
    - Color of tasks do not change based on current position on the list
    - Editing hides the 'add' box, preventing new tasks to be added while editing a task
    - Cannot have identical tasks
